Current design of MATHUSLA detector

MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra Stable neutraL pArticles

MATHUSLA is a large surface detector planned to be put 100 meters above the ATLAS or CMS. It is a large air filled decay volume with multi layer trackers and scintillators veto. It allows most trajectories of charged partilces to be individually measured and a Long lived particle is identified by reconstructing its displaced vertex.
